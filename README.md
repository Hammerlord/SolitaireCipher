# SolitaireCipher
A Python implementation of the Solitaire cipher.

One of my friends was working on this for a class assignment. I wasn't taking any such class at the time, but never one to be left out, I decided to do it too, as a little exercise. 

Probably the main challenge was finding a clear explanation of the algorithm rules... I ended up having to look up multiple articles on the subject.

Summary from Wikipedia:

> The Solitaire cryptographic algorithm was designed by Bruce Schneier at the request of Neal Stephenson for use in his novel Cryptonomicon, in which field agents use it to communicate securely without having to rely on electronics or having to carry incriminating tools.[1] It was designed to be a manual cryptosystem calculated with an ordinary deck of playing cards.
